# SphericalHarmonics
Spherical harmonics for radiance maps in Python (numpy). 

I wrote this code because I found it was difficult to obtain coefficients for a radiance map from existing libraries (especially in Python).

Features:
- Obtain coefficients for a radiance map (in equirectangular format)
- Numpy vectorised for efficiency
- Windowing function for reducing ringing artefacts
- Reconstruct radiance map from coefficients
- Obtain diffuse BRDF coefficients
- Render a diffuse map (given radiance map coefficients)
- Supports an arbitrary number of bands 
- Plot the spherical harmonics in a figure
- Render a ground truth diffuse map to compare with. 

The ground truth diffuse map can be a little slow to compute, so I've added the ability to render the diffuse values at a low resolution while sampling the high resolution source image. After rendering at a low resolution, I increase the resolution (so it's easier to see) using Lanczos interpolation. I found doing it this way was the most efficient while also producing high quality ground truth images.

# Usage
`python sphericalHarmonics.py [string filename.ext] [int nBands]`

For example:

`python sphericalHarmonics.py radianceMap.exr 2`

See the main function to see examples of functions you can utilise in your own code.

Things TODO if people want it:
- Support other formats (e.g. cubemap, angular map, etc.)
- Change, remove, or support other modules (e.g. I use imageio for reading HDR images, cv2 for resizing, etc.)
- More optimisations
- Other windowing methods
- Other visualisations
- Restructure code
- and more. Feel free to message me.

# Dependencies
You can use pip to install the modules I've used. The only gotcha is with imageio. By default it does not provide OpenEXR support.
To add OpenEXR support to imageio, see here:
https://imageio.readthedocs.io/en/stable/_autosummary/imageio.plugins.freeimage.html#module-imageio.plugins.freeimage

e.g., run the following in python (after installing imageio):
imageio.plugins.freeimage.download()
